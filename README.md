📘 Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming  
This repository contains my progress and projects from the Embedded Systems Bare-Metal Programming course on Udemy. The focus is on developing low-level embedded systems software for the STM32 microcontroller, without using HAL or any other high-level libraries—just bare-metal C. The goal is to interface directly with the hardware by manipulating registers, building a deeper understanding of microcontroller architectures, and writing highly optimized code.
  
🚀 Overview  
Throughout this course, I am working with the STM32L4 series microcontrollers to implement various low-level drivers and functions from scratch. By writing bare-metal C code, I am learning to control the microcontroller’s peripherals and perform key tasks, such as GPIO handling, UART communication, and managing system clocks, without relying on any abstraction layers.
  
⭐ Key Learning Objectives:  
○ Direct Register Manipulation: Access and control hardware by directly writing to memory-mapped registers.  
○ Peripheral Control: Learn how to configure and manage GPIO, UART, and other peripherals using bare-metal techniques.  
○ Driver Development: Build custom drivers for the STM32 peripherals (GPIO, UART, etc.).  
○ System Clock Setup: Configure the microcontroller’s clock without relying on default settings or external libraries.  
○ Interrupt Handling: Manage interrupts at the hardware level for real-time system responses.
